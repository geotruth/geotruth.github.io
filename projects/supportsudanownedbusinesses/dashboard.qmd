**About the Dashboard **
</br>


<span style="font-size: 1vw; width: 100%;"> 
The war in Sudan has affected millions of people. Over **25 million** Sudanese have been forced to leave their homes because of the fighting, and many have lost their jobs and businesses. In fact, about **50%** of people living in the Sudan have lost their jobs due to the conflict, making it even harder for families to survive and rebuild. <br> </br>
This dashboard is in place to help Sudanese-owned businesses and projects, both in Sudan and around the world (the diaspora). By supporting these businesses and projects, you’re helping people recover from the war in Sudan, get back to work, and rebuild their communities. Some busnesses and projects's strategic aim is to help people on the ground or pledge to support others affecte by war- in essence, your effort to support is compounded! <br></br>
We update submissions to this dashboard within a day or two. <br>For questions or edits reach us at: <a href="mailto:admin@geotruth.org" style="color: #0d807a;">admin@geotruth.org</a>
