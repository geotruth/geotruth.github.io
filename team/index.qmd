<h2>Hi, I'm [Rasha]{.gradient_text}.</h2>

</span> I am a geospatial epidemiologist. I am passionate about health equity and geospatial epidemiology. I love food and I love coding. But since I can't eat code, I automate my hydroponic garden to grow my food- Oh, of course, using code.

<h2>Hi, I'm [Aisha]{.gradient_text}.</h2>

</span> I am a rockstar. I am passionate about health equity and geospatial. I love to rock and roll. I support the team's projects to make sure no one is snoozing on the job, except if they are new parents (only exception). I also make a mean boss both at home and at work. Now get to work!

<h2>Hi, I'm [Jordan]{.gradient_text}.</h2>

</span> I am a fun person. I am passionate about things that matter. I love horse riding, hiking. I am a python programmer, I mean I am really a plumber. Code plumber. And can patch together some mean, beef automations that solve problems and probably leak more problems down the line.
