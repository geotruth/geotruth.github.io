# **A Beginner's Guide to Finding Geospatial Data: Essential Resources for New Geospatial Professionals**

Welcome to geo:truth's guide for new geospatial professionals eager to dive into the world of geospatial data!
Whether you're just starting out or looking to expand your toolkit, understanding where and how to find reliable geospatial data, especially for health-related applications, is crucial.
At geo:truth, we're dedicated to equipping you with the resources needed to uncover health disparities and address global challenges through geography.

# Why Geospatial Data Matters

Geospatial data forms the foundation of our work at geo:truth, enabling us to map patterns, identify high-risk areas, and develop targeted interventions to improve public health outcomes.
As a new geospatial professional, mastering the art of finding and utilizing geospatial and health data will empower you to make informed decisions and advocate for positive change.

# Where to Find Geospatial and Health Data

## 1. **Government Agencies:**

Government agencies are primary sources of authoritative and freely accessible geospatial and health-related data:

-   **US Geological Survey (USGS):** Provides topographic maps, land cover data, and more through their [National Map](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-geospatial-program/national-map).
-   **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):** Offers health-related geospatial data and maps via their [GIS and Public Health](https://www.cdc.gov/gis/index.html) portal.

## 2. **Open Data Portals:**

Explore these platforms for open geospatial and health-related datasets:

-   **Data.gov:** Access a wide range of datasets including environmental, economic, and health data from the U.S. government's [Geospatial Data](https://www.data.gov/geospatial/) section.
-   **Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx):** Provides health-related data from around the world. Explore their datasets through the [GHDx Data Portal](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/).

## 3. **Academic and Research Institutions:**

Universities and research institutions contribute valuable geospatial and health datasets:

-   **Harvard Dataverse:** Explore various research data, including geospatial datasets, at [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/).
-   **Stanford EarthWorks:** Offers geospatial data related to environmental and earth sciences. Discover datasets at [Stanford EarthWorks](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/).

# Health Data for Geospatial Epidemiology

Geospatial epidemiology relies on health data to analyze disease patterns and health outcomes across geographical areas.
Here are essential sources for health data:

-   **World Health Organization (WHO):** Provides global health statistics and data through their [Global Health Observatory](https://www.who.int/data/gho).
-   **HealthData.gov:** Offers health-related datasets from various U.S. government agencies. Explore datasets relevant to epidemiological research at [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/).
-   **National Institutes of Health (NIH):** Access health-related research data and resources, including epidemiological studies, at [NIH Data Sharing](https://datasharing.nih.gov/).

# Tips for Using Geospatial and Health Data Effectively

-   **Review Metadata:** Understand the characteristics and limitations of the data by reviewing metadata.
-   **Stay Current:** Update datasets regularly to ensure accuracy and relevance.
-   **Utilize GIS Software:** Learn to use Geographic Information System (GIS) software like QGIS or ArcGIS for data visualization and analysis.
