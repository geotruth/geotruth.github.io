# Standing Strong: Women of Color Navigating Team Dynamics with Sass and EQ

Hey there, fabulous women of color making waves in the team!
Let’s dive into a topic that’s all too familiar: navigating the tricky waters of team dynamics, especially when it comes to asserting ourselves and dealing with idea theft.
Ready to rock this with style and grace?
Let’s go!

Imagine yourself in a diverse team where your expertise and unique perspective shine bright.
Collaboration is the name of the game, but sometimes, amidst the brainstorming sessions and deadlines, your brilliant ideas might not always get the recognition they deserve.

Suddenly, in a meeting, you hear someone presenting your idea as their own.
Cue the eye-roll moment!
But hold up, here’s how you can handle it with finesse:

# **Document Your Brilliance**

Keep meticulous records of your ideas—emails, notes, presentations.
This isn’t just about staying organized; it’s about having proof of your creativity and hard work.

# **Channel Your Inner Queen**

When faced with idea theft, respond assertively and confidently.
You could say something like, “I’m glad you appreciate my idea!
Let’s collaborate to make it even more awesome.”

# **Build Your Support Squad**

Allies and mentors are your secret weapon.
Surround yourself with those who recognize and celebrate your contributions.
They’ll have your back when you need guidance or a pep talk.

# **Champion Recognition**

Advocate for a workplace where all voices are heard and ideas are celebrated, especially those from diverse perspectives.
Creating a culture of respect and acknowledgment benefits everyone.

# **Ninja Moves: Formal Channels**

If the situation persists, consider discussing it with your manager or HR.
Present your case calmly and with evidence to show the impact on team morale and outcomes.

# **Embrace EQ Power**

Understand where your colleagues are coming from.
Sometimes, they may not realize the impact of their actions.
Approach the situation with empathy and aim for a constructive resolution.

# **Know Your Value**

Your brilliance and unique viewpoint are invaluable.
If challenges persist, keep your options open for environments that truly appreciate and uplift your contributions.

# Finally

Navigating team dynamics with sass and EQ isn’t just about standing up for yourself—it’s about paving the way for a workplace where everyone feels empowered to shine.
By handling challenges with confidence and a touch of grace, you inspire others and elevate the team dynamic.

Remember, your voice matters.
Your ideas are sparks of brilliance that can ignite positive change.
With EQ as your superpower and a supportive squad by your side, you’re unstoppable.

Keep shining bright, queens!
The world needs your brilliance and your voice.
Let’s continue to rock the boat and create waves of change together!
