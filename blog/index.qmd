Welcome to my blog *The Training Loop*. Here's a loose collection of articles. Currently, there is no real ordering or coherent theme, but that might change in the future. I'm not very consistent with writing regular blog posts either -- I'm proud that I made it past the lonely "Hello World!" post though. If you want to get a notification when I add a new blog post, you can enter your email address at the bottom of the page. It's free and I won't send spam. I appreciate any kind of feedback, that's a source of motivation and a signal which topics actually resonate with readers.
