    "text": "Standing Strong: Women of Color Navigating Team Dynamics with Sass and EQ\nHey there, fabulous women of color making waves in the team! Let‚Äôs dive into a topic that‚Äôs all too familiar: navigating the tricky waters of team dynamics, especially when it comes to asserting ourselves and dealing with idea theft. Ready to rock this with style and grace? Let‚Äôs go!\nImagine yourself in a diverse team where your expertise and unique perspective shine bright. Collaboration is the name of the game, but sometimes, amidst the brainstorming sessions and deadlines, your brilliant ideas might not always get the recognition they deserve.\nSuddenly, in a meeting, you hear someone presenting your idea as their own. Cue the eye-roll moment! But hold up, here‚Äôs how you can handle it with finesse:\n\n\nDocument Your Brilliance\nKeep meticulous records of your ideas‚Äîemails, notes, presentations. This isn‚Äôt just about staying organized; it‚Äôs about having proof of your creativity and hard work.\n\n\nChannel Your Inner Queen\nWhen faced with idea theft, respond assertively and confidently. You could say something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you appreciate my idea! Let‚Äôs collaborate to make it even more awesome.‚Äù\n\n\nBuild Your Support Squad\nAllies and mentors are your secret weapon. Surround yourself with those who recognize and celebrate your contributions. They‚Äôll have your back when you need guidance or a pep talk.\n\n\nChampion Recognition\nAdvocate for a workplace where all voices are heard and ideas are celebrated, especially those from diverse perspectives. Creating a culture of respect and acknowledgment benefits everyone.\n\n\nNinja Moves: Formal Channels\nIf the situation persists, consider discussing it with your manager or HR. Present your case calmly and with evidence to show the impact on team morale and outcomes.\n\n\nEmbrace EQ Power\nUnderstand where your colleagues are coming from. Sometimes, they may not realize the impact of their actions. Approach the situation with empathy and aim for a constructive resolution.\n\n\nKnow Your Value\nYour brilliance and unique viewpoint are invaluable. If challenges persist, keep your options open for environments that truly appreciate and uplift your contributions.\n\n\nFinally\nNavigating team dynamics with sass and EQ isn‚Äôt just about standing up for yourself‚Äîit‚Äôs about paving the way for a workplace where everyone feels empowered to shine. By handling challenges with confidence and a touch of grace, you inspire others and elevate the team dynamic.\nRemember, your voice matters. Your ideas are sparks of brilliance that can ignite positive change. With EQ as your superpower and a supportive squad by your side, you‚Äôre unstoppable.\nKeep shining bright, queens! The world needs your brilliance and your voice. Let‚Äôs continue to rock the boat and create waves of change together!"

    "text": "Why Every Geospatial Professional + Researcher Needs a Professional Portfolio\nHello, budding geospatial professionals and curious readers! Whether you‚Äôre fresh out of university or deep into your career, having a professional portfolio is not just a nice-to-have; it‚Äôs a game-changer. If you‚Äôre wondering why, buckle up! We‚Äôre about to explore why creating and maintaining a professional portfolio is essential for your success in the geospatial field.\n\n\nShowcasing Your Skills and Personality\nImagine this: you‚Äôre at a networking event, and someone asks what you do. Instead of just telling them, what if you could show them? A professional portfolio lets you do just that. It‚Äôs a visual and interactive way to present your work, from GIS maps to spatial analysis projects. Potential employers, clients, or collaborators can see firsthand what you‚Äôre capable of and a touch of your personality. Seeing is believing, after all!\n\n\nStanding Out in a Crowded Field\nThe geospatial industry is growing rapidly. With more professionals entering the field, it‚Äôs crucial to stand out. A portfolio sets you apart from the crowd. It‚Äôs your personal brand, reflecting your style, expertise, and passion. When you apply for a job or a research grant, a well-organized portfolio can be the deciding factor that puts you ahead of the competition.\n\n\nKeeping Track of Your Achievements\nLet‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs easy to forget the details of all the projects you‚Äôve worked on. Your portfolio acts as a living document of your career. It helps you keep track of your achievements, big and small. This is especially handy when updating your resume or preparing for performance reviews. Plus, looking back at your accomplishments can be a great confidence booster!\n\n\nDemonstrating Your Growth\nA portfolio isn‚Äôt just about showcasing your best work; it‚Äôs also about showing your journey. It highlights your growth and development over time. Employers and collaborators appreciate seeing how you‚Äôve progressed, learned new skills, and tackled challenging projects. It paints a complete picture of who you are as a professional.\n\n\nNetworking and Collaboration\nIn the geospatial world, connections are everything. Sharing your portfolio with peers and industry leaders can open doors to new opportunities. It‚Äôs a great conversation starter and a way to network effectively. Moreover, collaborating with others becomes easier when they can quickly understand your expertise and previous work.\n\n\nMaking a Strong Online Presence\nIn today‚Äôs digital age, having an online portfolio is a must. It enhances your online presence and makes you more discoverable. Potential employers, clients, or collaborators often start their search online. By having a portfolio, you increase your chances of being found and considered for exciting opportunities. Think of it as your digital business card!\n\n\nInspiring Others\nYour portfolio can be a source of inspiration for other geospatial professionals and researchers. By sharing your work and experiences, you contribute to the community, offering insights and sparking new ideas. It‚Äôs a wonderful way to give back and foster a collaborative spirit in the industry.\n\n\nHow to Get Started\nNow that you‚Äôre convinced of the benefits, let‚Äôs talk about how to get started. Here are some tips for creating an outstanding geospatial portfolio:\n\nChoose the Right Platform: Select a platform that suits your needs. Websites like GitHub, Behance, or even a personal website can be great options.\nOrganize Your Work: Categorize your projects by type, such as GIS analysis, remote sensing, or cartography. Make it easy for viewers to navigate.\nInclude Descriptions: For each project, include a brief description of the objectives, methodologies, tools used, and the results. Highlight your role and contributions.\nUse Visuals: Geospatial work is inherently visual. Include maps, charts, and other visuals to make your portfolio engaging.\nKeep It Updated: Regularly update your portfolio with new projects and achievements. An outdated portfolio can do more harm than good.\nGet Feedback: Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask colleagues or mentors for feedback. They can provide valuable insights to improve your portfolio.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nCreating a professional portfolio might seem like a daunting task, but it‚Äôs worth the effort. It‚Äôs a powerful tool that can significantly impact your career in the geospatial field. So, what are you waiting for? Start building your portfolio today and watch your professional opportunities soar!\nHappy mapping, and may your geospatial journey be filled with exciting discoveries and achievements!"

    "section": "(completed) Spatial Analysis: Interplay between Armed Conflict, Livelihood, Environmental Factors and Malaria Risk in Sudan",
    "text": "(completed) Spatial Analysis: Interplay between Armed Conflict, Livelihood, Environmental Factors and Malaria Risk in Sudan\nBackground | There are complex interrelationships between armed conflict, livelihood patterns, environmental factors, and malaria risk across Sudan.\nPurpose\n\nAnalyze the spatial impact of armed conflict events on malaria prevalence.\nInvestigate how different livelihood zones, including Central Rainfed Millet and Sesame and Western Wadi Cultivation, influence malaria vulnerability.\nExamine the role of environmental factors, such as soil degradation and urbanization, in shaping malaria risk patterns in Sudan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\nDistance to Another Malaria Case: ¬†This was significant factor in disease risk, which makes sense. Being close to another malaria case, as a factor for malaria acquisition.\nDistance to an Armed Conflict Event: ¬†This was also a significant factor in malaria risk. It has been know that are strong linkages between the environment and conflict and has indirect impacts such as population displacement, lack of centralized governance, famine, conflicted-related resource exploitation, under-investment in sustainable development and poor access to health and health services increasing a disease risk for affected populations [2][3]. Competition over oil and gas reserves, Nile water between neighboring countries and tribes and land use issues pose a strong causative link to conflict perpetuation and instigation [2]. These issues are interlinked with social, political and economic issues affecting Sudan and its neighboring countries and middle east and western political interests and greed [2]. The cost is the health and lives of affected populations.\nLivelihood: Livelihood zones for ‚ÄúCentral Rainfed Millet and Sesame‚Äù and ‚ÄúNorthern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation‚Äù and ‚ÄúWestern Wadi Cultivation‚Äù were significant predictors of disease risk. ¬†\nThe Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation is intertwined with city life, (mentioned later in Urbanicity/Rurality Section). The White and Blue Niles both flowing at different speeds, bring in various minerals that make the soil near it fertile for cultivation. Small-scale cultivation that is intertwined with city life, involves taking advantage of the fertile soil near the White, Blue and Nile Rivers for cultivation of fruits vegetables and sometimes sorghum that is seasonal with the river flow and volume. People are near these small-scale cultivation, live near the river basins also and are dependent on this type of cultivation as a source of their livelihood‚Äîwhich makes sense that they are at risk for malaria. Mosquito vector is dependent on the human host and subtle water to breed, the small-scale cultivation areas near the river are the perfect stage.\nThere are water channels from the Blue Nile River that irrigate through (a process called: streamline irrigation‚Äîchanneling water from high to low regions) to the famous Al Gaziera Agricultural Scheme built by Reginald Wingate in 1904: which was an amassed production of cotton and improved the livelihood and economy of Sudan. The Gaziera Agricultural Scheme was one the largest irrigation projects in the world located southeast of the confluence of the Blue and White rivers in Khartoum. If not properly managed, these water channels can be breeding ground for mosquitoes and can pose high health risks for malaria for populations dependent on the channeling of water for agriculture and livelihood.\nCentral Rainfed Millet and Sesame: while the Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation zone is depended on White, Blue and Nile river cultivation, the Central Rainfed Millet and Sesame livelihood zones depend on rain for cultivation of sesame and millet (called ‚Äúdokhn‚Äù). And livelihood in the region of Kordofan, are dependent on rain for growing crops and for livestock.\nWestern Wadi Cultivation: This region also includes pools of water that are stagnant from the rain and natural water springs. The water springs and water pools, that collect from rain coming from valleys is the source of livelihood for feeding livestock and cultivation of crops. This type of cultivation feeds the western region of the Sudan and includes cultivation for vegetables, and fruits. This region do not include rivers as source of water, so rain is an important feature for livelihood.\nHuman Cause of Soil Degradation ‚Äì Overgrazing and Agriculture: Central to Sudan‚Äôs economy, livelihood is agriculture. Sudan is known as the ‚Äúfood basket food for the Arab world‚Äù, due to its geography and eco-climatic settings. Approximately 1/3 of Sudan is suitable for agriculture and livestock raising and between 65-75% of working populations depend on these two sources for livelihood [1] . These two sources also provide for 43% of the Sudan‚Äôs Gross Domestic Product. The sources of livelihood include: ‚Äúzoora‚Äù or sorghum, millet, gum Arabic, cotton, sesame and ground nut, for livestock and animal: sheep, camels, cattle and coastal fish [6].\nOvergrazing and agriculture were factors of human interference that has trigged degradation process, and this was significant in our final model in explaining our outcome of malaria risk.\nUrbanicity/Rurality: This was particularly surprising that urban areas were more likely to be predictor of malaria risk and this was significant.\nIn the recent decades as people have moved from rural to urban to find other sources of livelihood, urbanicity might explain our outcome (malaria risk) because in urban areas people tend to live more compactly (extended families of 2 or more generations). In the literature, there was evidence of the anopheles mosquito changing its breeding sites in urban settings due to the poor drainage infrastructure and being able to sustain host blood meals even in urban high structure buildings and in crevices of water-based air conditioners [4][5].\nAlso, in urban areas, particularly in Khartoum state and neighboring states that share the White and Blue Nile rivers, where we observed higher spatial intensity of malaria cases: there is a ‚Äúblend‚Äù of cultivated land ¬†agricultural practices that are a part of the urban city. For example, in the areas where agricultural fields are a part of the urban landscape‚ÄîIn the livelihood zone: Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation‚Äìthere several types of trees, and crops are grown, and some livestock roaming in parts of the city and these are a part of the livelihood of people in these regions.\nIn urban areas, people tend to sleep with windows open or sometimes in open rooftops, or with air conditioners, and be active into parts of the night as a part of the city-life and events and occasions that tend to be planned at nighttime due to the heat and high temperatures during the day.\nSoil Degradation Type: ¬†Areas that are ‚Äústable with permanent agriculture‚Äù and ‚Äúcompaction‚Äù were good predictors of estimating our outcome: malaria. 1/3 of Sudan‚Äôs land is suitable for agriculture and most of the livelihood of people depends on this. Compaction of soil is when heavy machinery is used to compact the soil and this can cause decreases the porosity of the soil [6]. Compaction coupled with erosion is detrimental to the environment and with decreased porosity of the soil, water puddles are formed as a result making a perfect storm for mosquito breeding.\n[1] (Elgali, Mustafa, & Bauer, 2010)\n[2] (UNEP, 2008)\n[3] (Mboera, Mfinanga, Karimuribo, Rumisha, & Sindato, 2014)\n[4] (Noor, et al., 2014)\n[5] (WHO-EMRO, 2017)\n[6] (FEWS NET, 2015)\n¬†\nData + Support - Thank you:\nGlobal Assessment of Human-induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD) | FEWS NET | Malaria Index Survey Sudan | Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) | Ministry of Health Sudan | Mustashfa Al Manateq AlHarra (Hospital of Tropical Diseases)\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio tag"
