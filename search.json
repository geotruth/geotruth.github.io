    "text": "The Impact of Geospatial Technologies on Public Health\nAt geo:truth, we are dedicated to using data and geography to drive positive change globally. Our mission is to uncover health disparities and tackle global challenges by harnessing the power of geospatial technologies. Today, we want to delve into how these innovative tools are transforming public health and advancing our mission to promote equity, innovation, and empowerment.\n\nHow Geospatial Technologies Address Public Health Challenges\nGeospatial technologies encompass a range of tools that capture, store, analyze, and visualize spatial data. These technologies include Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and spatial analysis techniques, all of which play a crucial role in understanding and addressing public health issues.\n\nDisease Surveillance and Outbreak Response: Geospatial technologies are instrumental in monitoring and responding to disease outbreaks. By mapping the spread of infectious diseases, public health officials can identify hotspots, track the progression of outbreaks, and allocate resources more effectively. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, GIS was used to visualize infection rates, hospital capacities, and vaccination distribution, enabling data-driven decision-making.\nEnvironmental Health and Pollution Tracking: Spatial analysis helps identify environmental factors that impact public health, such as air and water pollution, hazardous waste sites, and exposure to toxins. By overlaying health data with environmental data, researchers can uncover correlations between pollution and health outcomes, guiding interventions to mitigate risks and protect vulnerable populations.\nAccess to Healthcare Services: Geospatial technologies are used to assess and improve access to healthcare services, particularly in underserved and remote areas. By analyzing spatial data on healthcare facility locations, transportation networks, and population density, planners can identify gaps in service coverage and develop strategies to enhance accessibility. Mobile health clinics and telemedicine solutions, guided by geospatial analysis, are increasingly being deployed to reach isolated communities.\nHealth Equity and Social Determinants of Health: Geospatial analysis sheds light on the social determinants of health, such as income, education, housing, and access to nutritious food. By mapping these factors alongside health outcomes, researchers can identify disparities and design targeted interventions to address inequities. This approach is central to our work at geo:truth, as we strive to ensure that everyone, regardless of their zip code, has equal access to health and well-being.\n\n\n\nCase Studies and Our Work\nCase Study 1: Mapping Malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa\nIn collaboration with local health authorities, geo:truth used GIS to map the incidence of malaria Sudan. By analyzing spatial data on mosquito breeding sites, climate conditions, and population movement, we identified high-risk areas and optimized the distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and antimalarial drugs. This targeted approach could led to a significant reduction in malaria cases and improved health outcomes in the affected communities.\nCase Study 2: Assessing Health Impacts of Air Pollution in Cairo\nAs part of our ongoing research, geo:truth conducted a study on the health impacts of air pollution in Cairo, Egypt. Using remote sensing data and spatial analysis, we mapped pollution levels and correlated them with respiratory illness rates. The findings highlighted neighborhoods with high exposure to pollutants and elevated health risks. These insights informed policy recommendations for reducing emissions and protecting public health in the city.\n\n\nThe Role of Young Professionals\nYoung professionals are at the forefront of advancing geospatial technologies and their application in public health. Their innovative thinking, technological expertise, and commitment to social justice are driving transformative change. At geo:truth, we actively support and empower young geospatial epidemiologists and data scientists to contribute to our mission.\nBy providing training, mentorship, and opportunities for collaboration, we are building a new generation of leaders who will continue to harness the power of geospatial technologies to address health disparities and promote equity. We encourage young professionals to join us in this endeavor, bringing fresh perspectives and innovative solutions to the challenges we face.\n\n\nConclusion\nGeospatial technologies are revolutionizing public health by enabling more precise, data-driven interventions and fostering greater health equity. At geo:truth, we are committed to leveraging these tools to uncover and address health disparities, ensuring that everyone, everywhere, has access to the resources they need for a healthy life.\nStay tuned to our blog for more insights into our work and how you can get involved in advancing health equity through geospatial technologies. Together, we can make a difference.\nBy sharing these insights, we hope to inspire action and collaboration within the public health community and beyond.

Being close to another malaria case, as a factor for malaria acquisition.\nDistance to an Armed Conflict Event:  This was also a significant factor in malaria risk. It has been know that are strong linkages between the environment and conflict and has indirect impacts such as population displacement, lack of centralized governance, famine, conflicted-related resource exploitation, under-investment in sustainable development and poor access to health and health services increasing a disease risk for affected populations [2][3]. Competition over oil and gas reserves, Nile water between neighboring countries and tribes and land use issues pose a strong causative link to conflict perpetuation and instigation [2]. These issues are interlinked with social, political and economic issues affecting Sudan and its neighboring countries and middle east and western political interests and greed [2]. The cost is the health and lives of affected populations.\nLivelihood: Livelihood zones for “Central Rainfed Millet and Sesame” and “Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation” and “Western Wadi Cultivation” were significant predictors of disease risk.  \nThe Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation is intertwined with city life, (mentioned later in Urbanicity/Rurality Section). The White and Blue Niles both flowing at different speeds, bring in various minerals that make the soil near it fertile for cultivation. Small-scale cultivation that is intertwined with city life, involves taking advantage of the fertile soil near the White, Blue and Nile Rivers for cultivation of fruits vegetables and sometimes sorghum that is seasonal with the river flow and volume. People are near these small-scale cultivation, live near the river basins also and are dependent on this type of cultivation as a source of their livelihood—which makes sense that they are at risk for malaria. Mosquito vector is dependent on the human host and subtle water to breed, the small-scale cultivation areas near the river are the perfect stage.\nThere are water channels from the Blue Nile River that irrigate through (a process called: streamline irrigation—channeling water from high to low regions) to the famous Al Gaziera Agricultural Scheme built by Reginald Wingate in 1904: which was an amassed production of cotton and improved the livelihood and economy of Sudan. The Gaziera Agricultural Scheme was one the largest irrigation projects in the world located southeast of the confluence of the Blue and White rivers in Khartoum. If not properly managed, these water channels can be breeding ground for mosquitoes and can pose high health risks for malaria for populations dependent on the channeling of water for agriculture and livelihood.\nCentral Rainfed Millet and Sesame: while the Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation zone is depended on White, Blue and Nile river cultivation, the Central Rainfed Millet and Sesame livelihood zones depend on rain for cultivation of sesame and millet (called “dokhn”). And livelihood in the region of Kordofan, are dependent on rain for growing crops and for livestock.\nWestern Wadi Cultivation: This region also includes pools of water that are stagnant from the rain and natural water springs. The water springs and water pools, that collect from rain coming from valleys is the source of livelihood for feeding livestock and cultivation of crops. This type of cultivation feeds the western region of the Sudan and includes cultivation for vegetables, and fruits. This region do not include rivers as source of water, so rain is an important feature for livelihood.\nHuman Cause of Soil Degradation – Overgrazing and Agriculture: Central to Sudan’s economy, livelihood is agriculture. Sudan is known as the “food basket food for the Arab world”, due to its geography and eco-climatic settings. Approximately 1/3 of Sudan is suitable for agriculture and livestock raising and between 65-75% of working populations depend on these two sources for livelihood [1] . These two sources also provide for 43% of the Sudan’s Gross Domestic Product. The sources of livelihood include: “zoora” or sorghum, millet, gum Arabic, cotton, sesame and ground nut, for livestock and animal: sheep, camels, cattle and coastal fish [6].\nOvergrazing and agriculture were factors of human interference that has trigged degradation process, and this was significant in our final model in explaining our outcome of malaria risk.\nUrbanicity/Rurality: This was particularly surprising that urban areas were more likely to be predictor of malaria risk and this was significant.\nIn the recent decades as people have moved from rural to urban to find other sources of livelihood, urbanicity might explain our outcome (malaria risk) because in urban areas people tend to live more compactly (extended families of 2 or more generations). In the literature, there was evidence of the anopheles mosquito changing its breeding sites in urban settings due to the poor drainage infrastructure and being able to sustain host blood meals even in urban high structure buildings and in crevices of water-based air conditioners [4][5].\nAlso, in urban areas, particularly in Khartoum state and neighboring states that share the White and Blue Nile rivers, where we observed higher spatial intensity of malaria cases: there is a “blend” of cultivated land  agricultural practices that are a part of the urban city. For example, in the areas where agricultural fields are a part of the urban landscape—In the livelihood zone: Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation–there several types of trees, and crops are grown, and some livestock roaming in parts of the city and these are a part of the livelihood of people in these regions.\nIn urban areas, people tend to sleep with windows open or sometimes in open rooftops, or with air conditioners, and be active into parts of the night as a part of the city-life and events and occasions that tend to be planned at nighttime due to the heat and high temperatures during the day.\nSoil Degradation Type:  Areas that are “stable with permanent agriculture” and “compaction” were good predictors of estimating our outcome: malaria. 1/3 of Sudan’s land is suitable for agriculture and most of the livelihood of people depends on this. Compaction of soil is when heavy machinery is used to compact the soil and this can cause decreases the porosity of the soil [6]. Compaction coupled with erosion is detrimental to the environment and with decreased porosity of the soil, water puddles are formed as a result making a perfect storm for mosquito breeding.\n[1] (Elgali, Mustafa, & Bauer, 2010)\n[2] (UNEP, 2008)\n[3] (Mboera, Mfinanga, Karimuribo, Rumisha, & Sindato, 2014)\n[4] (Noor, et al., 2014)\n[5] (WHO-EMRO, 2017)\n[6] (FEWS NET, 2015)\n \nData + Support - Thank you:\nGlobal Assessment of Human-induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD) | FEWS NET | Malaria Index Survey Sudan | Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) | Ministry of Health Sudan | Mustashfa Al Manateq AlHarra (Hospital of Tropical Diseases)\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio tag"

By mapping health inequities, healthcare providers can identify communities with higher disease burdens and target interventions to those most in need.\nOne key application of geospatial data is identifying social determinants of health (SDOH) that contribute to health inequities. SDOH include factors such as income, education, employment, housing, and access to healthcare services. By analyzing spatial data on SDOH, healthcare providers can identify neighborhoods with higher levels of disadvantage and develop targeted interventions to address these inequities.\nGeospatial data also informs public health policy and resource allocation. By providing evidence-based insights into the geographic distribution of health inequities, policymakers can make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and implement programs to reduce health inequities."

Integrating Geospatial Data into Clinical Practice\nIntegrating geospatial data into clinical practice involves using spatial information to enhance patient care and improve health outcomes. Healthcare providers can leverage geospatial data to gain a deeper understanding of the social and environmental factors affecting their patients’ health.\nOne approach to integrating geospatial data into clinical practice is through geographic health information systems (GHIS). GHIS combine patient data with spatial data to create detailed maps that visualize health outcomes, disease patterns, and risk factors. These maps can help healthcare providers identify high-risk areas, allocate resources more effectively, and tailor interventions to specific communities.\nFor example, geospatial data can be used to identify areas with limited access to healthcare services, known as healthcare deserts. By mapping these areas, healthcare providers can develop strategies to improve access to care, such as establishing new clinics or mobile health units.\nMoreover, geospatial data can support population health management by enabling healthcare providers to monitor and address health inequities at the community level. By integrating spatial data into electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical decision support systems, healthcare providers can better understand the context of their patients’ health and deliver more personalized care."

The findings informed targeted interventions, such as implementing air quality improvement programs and increasing access to asthma care services in high-risk areas.\n\n\nCase Study 2: Addressing Rural Health Inequities\nIn a rural region, healthcare providers used geospatial data to identify barriers to healthcare access, including long travel distances to medical facilities and limited availability of healthcare providers. The study’s findings led to the development of telehealth programs and mobile clinics, which improved access to care for rural residents and reduced health inequities.\n\n\nBest Practice 1: Community Engagement and Collaboration\nEngaging communities and collaborating with local stakeholders is essential for successful geospatial data integration in clinical care. By involving community members in the research process, healthcare providers can gain valuable insights into local health challenges and ensure that interventions are culturally relevant and effective.\n\n\nBest Practice 2: Leveraging Advanced Geospatial Technologies\nThe use of advanced geospatial technologies, such as satellite imagery, remote sensing, and machine learning, can enhance the accuracy and scope of geospatial data integration in clinical care. These technologies enable healthcare providers to collect and analyze large-scale spatial data, providing more comprehensive insights into health inequities.\n\n\nBest Practice 3: Integrating Multidisciplinary Approaches\nGeospatial data integration benefits from multidisciplinary approaches, combining expertise from fields such as public health, geography, environmental science, and social sciences. This holistic approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex factors contributing to health inequities and the development of more effective interventions.\nBy integrating geospatial data into clinical care, healthcare providers can better understand and address the spatial dimensions of health inequities. Through targeted interventions, informed policy decisions, and innovative use of geospatial data, we can work towards a more equitable and healthier future for all communities.\nEmail us: admin@geotruth.org if you ways we can collaborate with you as a healthcare organization. We’d love to hear from you!"
