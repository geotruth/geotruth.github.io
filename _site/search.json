    "title": "4 Realizations from Atomic Habits",
    "section": "",
    "text": "About Atomic Habits\nIn his best-selling book Atomic Habits*, the author James Clear argues that the key to making meaningful progress in our lives is not about making grand, sweeping changes, but rather about building small, incremental habits that compound over time. With his scientific approach to habit formation and practical, actionable advice, James Clear shows readers how to break bad habits and form good ones to achieve their goals and improve their lives. Whether you’re looking to improve your health, increase your wealth, or achieve personal growth, Atomic Habits* offers a simple yet powerful framework for making positive changes that stick.\nIt has gained international attention: At the time of writing this blog post, over 8 million copies have been sold. The title “Atomic Habits” immediately drew my attention. It communicates the idea that small, incremental changes can have a significant impact on our lives. Much like atoms, which are the basic building blocks of matter.1 These small habits, or “atomic habits”, can either work for or against us, depending on whether they are positive or negative. By focusing on building positive atomic habits, we can make significant progress towards our goals and create a better life for ourselves. “Atomic” captures the very essence of behavior change from a psychological perspective:\n1 dear physicist reading this: ‘basic building blocks’ is meant figuratively. Please resist the urge to correct this ;)\nAtoms are tiny. Behavior change needs to happen in tiny bits to be sustainable.\nAtoms are crucial building blocks of the world around us. Likewise, habits are crucial building blocks of human behavior.\n\nBoth aspects surface throughout the book in different forms, in different contexts, and with different implications. Yet, if I were to explain the very core idea of the book to someone in under 30 seconds, I would build on peoples’ pre-existing intuition of what makes something atomic.\nIn this blog post, I am in a lucky position to have more than 30 seconds. That’s why I want to share my personal four realizations from the book Atomic Habits.\n\n\nRealization 1: Four Laws of Behavior Change\nJames Clear builds his method on an adapted version of classical behavioral Psychology:\n\nCue → Craving → Action → Reward\n\nEach step is a cogwheel to increase the chance to perform a good habit. The framework for working with these cogwheels are the Four Laws of Behavior Change. Each law can be inverted to decrease the odds of a bad habit, but more on that later.\n\n\n\nStage\nLaw: Good Habits\nInverted Law: Bad Habits\n\n\n\n\n1: Cue\nMake it visible\nMake it invisible\n\n\n2: Craving\nMake it attractive\nMake it unattractive\n\n\n3: Action\nMake it easy\nMake it difficult\n\n\n4: Reward\nMake it satisfying\nMake it unsatisfying\n\n\n\nThese laws form the core framework of the book. Each law can be used to facilitate good habits and make you stop bad habits. It’s straightforward to think of examples for each law:\n\nLaw 1: Make it visible\nI want to read more. That’s why I try to keep a book right at my bedside table. When I go to bed at night and see a book there, I always pick it up and read a bit.\nImplementing the habit of reading each night literally made me buy the book Atomic Habits*. Some time ago, I attended a software engineering workshop and spent a night at an AirBnB. On my way to the workshop, I realized that I forgot the book I was currently reading at home. I went to an English book store and Atomic Habits* was the first book that I grabbed – what a fortunate coincidence!\n\n\nLaw 2: Make it attractive\nLet’s say you want to start exercising regularly, but you struggle to find the motivation to do so. One way to make exercise more attractive is to find a form of physical activity that you genuinely enjoy, such as dancing, swimming, or playing a sport. By choosing an activity that you find enjoyable, you are more likely to look forward to your workouts and be motivated to do them consistently. You could also try finding a workout buddy or joining a class to make the experience more social and enjoyable. By making exercise more attractive, you are more likely to stick with it and make it a regular part of your routine.\n\nDeep Dive: The attractiveness of some behavior refers to how tempting the behavior is when looking forward to it. That’s not the same as satisfying behavior. Consider the example of regular exercise: The problem is that most people (me included) just don’t exercise in the first place because it is unattractive in anticipation. However, once I get in my running shoes and start exercising, I enjoy it. It is unattractive in anticipation but satisfying in action.\n\n\n\nLaw 3: Make it easy\nA linter is a tool that checks your code for syntax errors and style issues, such as indentation errors, unnecessary white space, or naming conventions. By using a linter, you can catch and fix these issues before you run your code, which can save you time and frustration. This can be particularly helpful when working on a team, as it can help to ensure that your code is consistent with the project’s style guidelines.\nIn this way, using a linter can be seen as a way of applying the third law of behavior change (make it easy) to your Python coding. By automating the process of checking your code for errors and style issues, a linter makes it easier for you to write clean and organized Python code. This can save you time and effort and help you avoid common coding mistakes. By making it easy to write clean Python code, you are more likely to build the habit of producing high-quality code that is easy to read and maintain.\n\n\nLaw 4: Make it satisfying\nI want to reduce avoidable expenses. However, not buying that croissant at the bakery does not bring any joy by itself: I am not a frugalist who finds the actual act of not spending money attractive. To make not spending money satisfying, I transfer the money that I did not spend on that croissant to a savings account. The money in this savings account is dedicated to non-essential stuff which I really want to purchase (but won’t buy right away because I’m trying to be financially responsible).\nIt turns out that the money from unbought stuff adds up. For instance, I recently purchased an awesome outdoor pizza oven from the accumulated money in this savings account. In hindsight, that pizza oven is way more satisfying than all the croissants, coffees, and chocolate bars that I did not buy. And that makes not buying that croissant incredibly satisfying for me – because I replace this action with the action “transfer the croissant money to the savings account”.\n\nDeep Dive: “Transfer the croissant money to the savings account” is again a habit that is governed by the Four Laws. For instance, Law 2 (make it easy): If wiring money requires going to the bank and filling out a transaction form (difficult), I would probably stop doing it after a couple of times. Instead, I simply use my mobile phone for the transaction and it takes less than a minute (easy).\n\n\n\n\nRealization 2: Real-life situations are inverse\nInteresting real-life scenarios are a little more complicated – they are often inverse to the actual theory. Let me explain what I mean by this cryptic sentence. What we did so far is take a Law (e.g., make it visible) and think about examples of where we might apply that strategy. Real-life usually works the opposite way: We begin the thought process with a good habit we want to implement (or a bad habit we want to stop). Then, we need to figure out a strategy to achieve this intention: Should we first try to make this bad habit invisible, unattractive, difficult, or unsatisfying? We definitely should not try to do all of the above at once, because this might be too big of a change and we probably get back to normal after a week. So we need a method to identify potential angles to tackle our intention. James Clear proposes to first analyze the habit of interest and identify its cue, craving, action, and reward. Let’s apply this framework to a habit of mine that I want to stop:\nChecking my emails disrupts my flow state when I am programming. That’s why I deliberately don’t use a proper e-mail program (like Outlook) on my work laptop. Instead, I need to manually log in to each of my mail accounts to check my emails. That’s just enough of a barrier for me to not check my emails every other minute.\n\n\nRealization 3: Habits do not stack, habits compound\nJames Clear makes a fair point when he claims that habits are the compound interest of behavior change.\n\nWait, like compound interest? What is this, a pyramid scheme?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHabits can be thought of as the compound interest of behavior change because, like compound interest, they have a cumulative effect that grows over time. When you develop a new habit, it may seem small and insignificant at first. However, as you continue to practice that habit day after day, it gradually becomes stronger and more ingrained in your routine. When we perform a behavior consistently, it becomes a habit, which means we can do it automatically without having to think about it. This frees up our mental energy and allows us to focus on other things. The impact of habits is often not immediately noticeable, but over time they can have a significant effect on our lives.\nLet’s say you want to improve your physical fitness and develop the habit of exercising regularly. At first, you may struggle to find the motivation to exercise and may not see significant progress in your fitness level. However, as you continue to exercise consistently, you will begin to see small improvements in your strength and endurance.\nAs you continue to exercise consistently over time, those small improvements will compound and you will see more significant progress in your fitness level. You may find that you can run longer distances, lift heavier weights, or perform other physical activities with greater ease. These improvements will encourage you to continue exercising regularly, and the habit will become stronger and more ingrained in your routine.\nIn this way, the habit of exercising regularly can be seen as the compound interest of behavior change. By starting small and building upon that habit over time, you can make significant progress in your physical fitness and improve your overall health and well-being.\n\n\nRealization 4: Many habits fly under the radar\nHabits are deeply routed and fully automatic. More often than not, we are completely unaware of our habits. For instance, I was on vacation recently. During my vacation, I wanted to resist the urge to read any work-related emails or messages on my phone.\nTo make the habit of reading work-related messages invisible (1st Law), I just deleted Slack from my phone. That one was easy. In contrast, deleting the email app from my phone wasn’t as easy because (i) I needed access to private emails; and (ii) re-configuring my entire email app after the vacation would take way too long. That’s why I simply moved the email app from my phone’s fast access bar into some junkyard folder that’s crammed with unused apps.\nI was surprised by what happened during my vacation: Whenever I unlocked my phone, my thumb would automatically gravitate to the fast access bar where the email app used to be! Moving the app to another location made me realize how deeply automated the habit of opening the email app upon unlocking my phone had become over the past years. The brief moment of irritation when my brain realized that the app is no longer at its usual place was enough to achieve a crucial step to change bad habits: It made the bad habit visible – I was finally aware of it!\n\nPsychologists would say that the behavior has become salient.\n\nReturning from my vacation, my email app did not make it back to the fast access bar. Whenever I want to check my emails on my mobile phone, I now need to navigate into that dusty jukyard folder This makes the habit of checking emails on my phone just a little more invisible and just a little more difficult. I appreciate that.\n\n\nConclusion\nReading Atomic Habits* started as a work trip accident because I forgot my other book at home. I must admit that it was a fortunate accident There are two more closing remarks I want to make.\nFirst, the book matched well with my own previous experience on behavior change. I could see many parallels to what has worked well for me in the past, and found those things that went poorly for me in the past in the book’s counter-examples. At the same time, the book gave me a proper vocabulary for all my implicit knowledge and experience on behavior change. Now, I have the right words to express what I have been experiencing all along. This makes the topic of behavior change much more actionable, and that’s basis for achieving sustainable change.\nSecond, Atomic Habits* is a rather light read, but it does contain a lot of information, and many claims are backed by scientific references. I would often find myself thinking “well, that claim is far-fetched”, just to see that James Clear did actually provide an academic paper to support that claim in the appendix. As a scientist, I appreciate this a lot, and I know that this is not common practice in this genre of books.\nIn conclusion, Atomic Habits* by James Clear offers a simple yet powerful framework for making positive changes that stick. By focusing on building small, incremental habits that compound over time, we can make meaningful progress toward our goals and improve our lives. Clear’s scientific approach to habit formation and practical, actionable advice make it an invaluable resource for anyone looking to break bad habits and form good ones.\nTo take action based on the ideas in this book, consider the following steps:\n\nIdentify a specific goal or habit that you want to work on.\nMake a plan for how you will build this habit, using the four laws of behavior change: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying.\nTrack your progress and celebrate your successes along the way.\nSeek out resources and support to help you stay motivated and on track.\n\nBy following these steps, you can begin to build the atomic habits that will help you achieve your goals and create a better life for yourself.\nI can highly recommend reading Atomic Habits* to find out more about the patterns in your habits. You might just get some inspiration about how to stop this one habit that you have been trying to get rid of for years.\n\nAffiliate link disclaimer: This post may contain affiliate links.

    "text": "Spatial Analysis: Interplay between Armed Conflict, Livelihood, Environmental Factors and Malaria Risk in Sudan\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Findings\nDistance to Another Malaria Case:  This was significant factor in disease risk, which makes sense. Being close to another malaria case, as a factor for malaria acquisition.\nDistance to an Armed Conflict Event:  This was also a significant factor in malaria risk. It has been know that are strong linkages between the environment and conflict and has indirect impacts such as population displacement, lack of centralized governance, famine, conflicted-related resource exploitation, under-investment in sustainable development and poor access to health and health services increasing a disease risk for affected populations [2][3]. Competition over oil and gas reserves, Nile water between neighboring countries and tribes and land use issues pose a strong causative link to conflict perpetuation and instigation [2]. These issues are interlinked with social, political and economic issues affecting Sudan and its neighboring countries and middle east and western political interests and greed [2]. The cost is the health and lives of affected populations.\nLivelihood: Livelihood zones for “Central Rainfed Millet and Sesame” and “Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation” and “Western Wadi Cultivation” were significant predictors of disease risk.  \nThe Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation is intertwined with city life, (mentioned later in Urbanicity/Rurality Section). The White and Blue Niles both flowing at different speeds, bring in various minerals that make the soil near it fertile for cultivation. Small-scale cultivation that is intertwined with city life, involves taking advantage of the fertile soil near the White, Blue and Nile Rivers for cultivation of fruits vegetables and sometimes sorghum that is seasonal with the river flow and volume. People are near these small-scale cultivation, live near the river basins also and are dependent on this type of cultivation as a source of their livelihood—which makes sense that they are at risk for malaria. Mosquito vector is dependent on the human host and subtle water to breed, the small-scale cultivation areas near the river are the perfect stage.\nThere are water channels from the Blue Nile River that irrigate through (a process called: streamline irrigation—channeling water from high to low regions) to the famous Al Gaziera Agricultural Scheme built by Reginald Wingate in 1904: which was an amassed production of cotton and improved the livelihood and economy of Sudan. The Gaziera Agricultural Scheme was one the largest irrigation projects in the world located southeast of the confluence of the Blue and White rivers in Khartoum. If not properly managed, these water channels can be breeding ground for mosquitoes and can pose high health risks for malaria for populations dependent on the channeling of water for agriculture and livelihood.\nCentral Rainfed Millet and Sesame: while the Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation zone is depended on White, Blue and Nile river cultivation, the Central Rainfed Millet and Sesame livelihood zones depend on rain for cultivation of sesame and millet (called “dokhn”). And livelihood in the region of Kordofan, are dependent on rain for growing crops and for livestock.\nWestern Wadi Cultivation: This region also includes pools of water that are stagnant from the rain and natural water springs. The water springs and water pools, that collect from rain coming from valleys is the source of livelihood for feeding livestock and cultivation of crops. This type of cultivation feeds the western region of the Sudan and includes cultivation for vegetables, and fruits. This region do not include rivers as source of water, so rain is an important feature for livelihood.\nHuman Cause of Soil Degradation – Overgrazing and Agriculture: Central to Sudan’s economy, livelihood is agriculture. Sudan is known as the “food basket food for the Arab world”, due to its geography and eco-climatic settings. Approximately 1/3 of Sudan is suitable for agriculture and livestock raising and between 65-75% of working populations depend on these two sources for livelihood [1] . These two sources also provide for 43% of the Sudan’s Gross Domestic Product. The sources of livelihood include: “zoora” or sorghum, millet, gum Arabic, cotton, sesame and ground nut, for livestock and animal: sheep, camels, cattle and coastal fish [6].\nOvergrazing and agriculture were factors of human interference that has trigged degradation process, and this was significant in our final model in explaining our outcome of malaria risk.\nUrbanicity/Rurality: This was particularly surprising that urban areas were more likely to be predictor of malaria risk and this was significant.\nIn the recent decades as people have moved from rural to urban to find other sources of livelihood, urbanicity might explain our outcome (malaria risk) because in urban areas people tend to live more compactly (extended families of 2 or more generations). In the literature, there was evidence of the anopheles mosquito changing its breeding sites in urban settings due to the poor drainage infrastructure and being able to sustain host blood meals even in urban high structure buildings and in crevices of water-based air conditioners [4][5].\nAlso, in urban areas, particularly in Khartoum state and neighboring states that share the White and Blue Nile rivers, where we observed higher spatial intensity of malaria cases: there is a “blend” of cultivated land  agricultural practices that are a part of the urban city. For example, in the areas where agricultural fields are a part of the urban landscape—In the livelihood zone: Northern Riverine Small-scale Cultivation–there several types of trees, and crops are grown, and some livestock roaming in parts of the city and these are a part of the livelihood of people in these regions.\nIn urban areas, people tend to sleep with windows open or sometimes in open rooftops, or with air conditioners, and be active into parts of the night as a part of the city-life and events and occasions that tend to be planned at nighttime due to the heat and high temperatures during the day.\nSoil Degradation Type:  Areas that are “stable with permanent agriculture” and “compaction” were good predictors of estimating our outcome: malaria. 1/3 of Sudan’s land is suitable for agriculture and most of the livelihood of people depends on this. Compaction of soil is when heavy machinery is used to compact the soil and this can cause decreases the porosity of the soil [6]. Compaction coupled with erosion is detrimental to the environment and with decreased porosity of the soil, water puddles are formed as a result making a perfect storm for mosquito breeding.\n[1] (Elgali, Mustafa, & Bauer, 2010)\n[2] (UNEP, 2008)\n[3] (Mboera, Mfinanga, Karimuribo, Rumisha, & Sindato, 2014)\n[4] (Noor, et al., 2014)\n[5] (WHO-EMRO, 2017)\n[6] (FEWS NET, 2015)\n \nData + Support - Thank you:\nGlobal Assessment of Human-induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD) | FEWS NET | Malaria Index Survey Sudan | Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) | Ministry of Health Sudan | Mustashfa Al Manateq AlHarra (Hospital of Tropical Diseases)\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio tag"

Through your website, you can foster collaborations, exchange ideas, and forge valuable connections.\n\n\nReason 3: Have Control Over Your Content\nIn today’s digital age, maintaining control over your online presence is essential. While social media platforms and other online channels offer great reach, they often come with limitations and constraints. A personal website grants you the freedom to share your research findings, insights, and perspectives on your own terms. You are not bound by character counts or algorithmic filters. This level of control allows you to maintain a professional online persona while freely expressing your thoughts and ideas.\n\n\nReason 4: Reach an Audience\nWhile traditional scientific publications are the currency of academia, their reach can be limited. A personal website breaks down these barriers and makes you reach a global audience. By sharing your research with the world, you can engage with science enthusiasts, inspire others, and make a lasting impact beyond academic papers. Whether your goal is to communicate complex scientific concepts to a broader audience or connect with fellow researchers on a global scale, a personal website will bring you one step closer to your goal.\n\n\nReason 5: Enhance Opportunities\nA personal website is a way for potential employers and academic institutions to find out about your work, achievements, and contributions. It offers them a comprehensive understanding of your expertise, research interests, and the impact of your work. By showcasing your accomplishments and highlighting your unique perspectives, you can enhance your chances of exciting career opportunities.\n\n\nHow to Start Today\nSo why wait? Take the leap and create your personal website today! To assist you, I have prepared a free tutorial and template to get you started on the right foot:\n\n\n\nConclusion\nHaving a personal website empowers you to showcase your work, expand your professional network, maintain control over your content, reach a global audience, and enhance your career opportunities. Remember: Your research is valuable, and you can create a personal website to put yourself out there and share your knowledge with others in no time."
